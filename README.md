AMD GPU. FPS Cap to 153. linkTest.js open in a maximized window of Sublime Text with around 20 blank lines below doc text. 

Look at pronounsFemale line. Look at / internally pronounce "she","her" in that order. Now mirror, and mirror over again about 5 times. Exit on "she", looking down and then glancing up and down entire doc several times. Aim for 4 total from first top to bottom glance. top to bottom. bottom to top each count toward. So 2 full down then up.

Return to pronounsFemale. Read "she","her" once. Look to articles. Glance forwards over [], and as look "a" think "an" as look "an" think "a". Think =~= pronounce internally. Then as look comma in-between "she" "her", think "an".


Try to point gaze around mStuff - cmsStuff, glance up to pets line, then over and over move up/down from pets to very bottom of doc.

After 5 or so times, do "cat" & "dog" hypnosis process. Which is to look at / internally pronounce "cat","dog" with mirror component so "cat","dog","dog","cat","cat","dog" a total of 5 2 word reads. At this point, while looking at "dog", think "cat". Continue with 7 2 word reads. Finally, stop at "dog" 3 seconds. Now persist with mirrored 2 words reads at least 7x.

 
Process A: 

With 2 lines directly adjacent (neighboring vertically), do as follows:
1. Pick 1 of the 2 lines. Pick 2 adjacent words (same line) to read. As you read one, think the other. You can read left to right or right to left. Repeat on the other line, but once done, return to the first line read from and as you focus on the comma of this first line, think the 2nd word thought on the 2nd line. 


Do process A with mStuff and cmStuff.
Do process A with navNorth and navMaj.


Use "dong gong song" & "Jax Lee Sin Irelia" along with various combinations among to help exit hypnosis, both while retaining the fps trick & without out, both with and without the document ahead of you. Look up and down document while saying these.
